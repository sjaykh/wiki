I don't know exactly when this started. Probably would have been when I saw JJ Abram's Super 8. The lens flares in it swept me right off my feet.&#x20;

The more I watched movies, there were some movies with great aesthetics that just made me go, "That's Cinema". Apparently most of those movies were shot in anamorphic lens.&#x20;

Anamorphic + Shot on film is the ðŸ”¥

The grainy texture of film with the epic scope that anamorphic gives is a damn good experience, like that in the case of 'The Batman'&#x20;

I am trying to learn more about anamorphic lens and why it makes the movie look so damn good.&#x20;

PTA's "Punch Drunk Love" literally plays around with anamorphic lens flare and I can't get enough of it.&#x20;

In Malayalam, "Lucifer" was shot on anamorphic lens. Again, I guess Prithviraj chose that to create the epicness in each frame which a movie like Lucifer demanded.&#x20;
