[Dropbox VP, Product and Growth Adam Nash on great product leaders | Amplify 2019](https://youtu.be/24F8WlyMR00?si=-I57inSzH6tX441S)

- Metrics movers
- Request
- Delight - features that surprise people.
- Maintain three separate list else you'll  end up with only metric movers. There's no single prioritised list.
- We're too rationally looking at user need not emotionally.
- Talk about emotion and add it into the process. Linkedin job hope example. Magic aha emtoionql moment.
- We keep crowding our product.
- Einsteins razor. Make things simple not simpler. Why did apple keep the home button?
- Obsess about non users. Asking what you can do to make it better.
- Product teams have the power to frame discussions with strategy and metrics.
- We tend to focus on data we have and not ask question's about data we don't have.
- Solve the product maze backwards. It is not a matter of should but it is a matter of when. How you frame a problem will lead the team.
- Designers can show people what could be.
- Engineers know what can and cannot be done.
- Products are never done. Your users deserve perfection.  How you behave and value your teams abd how you frame your problems.
- Be in a constant growth mindset.
