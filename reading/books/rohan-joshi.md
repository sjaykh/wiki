  I only wish to remain as curious and excited about books, shows and movies as
  Rohan is as I age.

# ðŸ˜€ Rohan Joshi

> Rohan Joshi is that elder brother who will find you, getting bored at a corner at a marriage ceremony you aren't even interested to be a part at all & will start talking about everything under the sun. Then as you go back to your place, you get a paper, a pen & make a list of all the cool suggestions he gave. You start watching them. Which slowly change your entire perspective to the world. & you never really get a chance to thank him for shaping up your taste. Instead what you do, you pass on the suggestion list to another kid getting bored somewhere sometime. That's how it goes on. &#x20;
