# üçÉ Learning to read faster.

Not a major issue, but it would be cool to read faster and cover ground esp. in the case of fiction books.&#x20;

One thing I have noticed which slows me down is saying the words out loud in my head and ofcourse the ADHD is another thing but that is for another day.&#x20;

What ChatGPT suggests,&#x20;

1. **Continue Practicing**: Regular reading will naturally improve your speed and comprehension.
2. **Use a Pointer**: Guide your eyes with your finger or a pen to maintain focus and speed.
3. **Avoid Subvocalization**: Try not to silently pronounce each word in your head. Practice reading larger chunks of text.
4. **Expand Peripheral Vision**: Train your eyes to take in more words at a glance, reducing the number of stops your eyes make.
5. **Preview the Text**: Skim through the text first to get an idea of its structure and main points.
6. **Improve Vocabulary**: A stronger vocabulary reduces the time spent decoding unfamiliar words.
7. **Utilize Speed Reading Apps**: Apps like Spreeder, Speed Reader, and others offer exercises to boost reading speed.
