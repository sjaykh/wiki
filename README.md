When we were in school, in between classes and during breaks there was this amazing place to I used to go to. It was my rough book.&#x20;

Every idea, thoughts, sketches, jokes I had; got recorded in some of those pages. There was a huge sense of relief when all those heavy ideas got written down somewhere. On revisiting, some of those ideas inspire me, other make me think, and some make me laugh.&#x20;

Digital garden is a much cooler, public rough book I guess. Things I am curious about, interested about will be shared here.&#x20;

"If your notebook is clean, chances are that you haven't done any thinking" My physics teacher told me.

Ideas are messy. They can't be aesthetically recorded after a sudden revelation. You record it, revisit it, strikethrough it. The joy and the learning happens in this process.&#x20;

We were taught to keep our notebooks clean, erase our mistakes. My teacher helped me understand that, mistakes are not meant to be hidden. It is where the real learning happens. Own your mistakes, be proud of it. And probably write about it in a wiki.&#x20;

The last sentence was me trying to be funny. (in case you didn't get it :joy:)
