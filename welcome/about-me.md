# 👋 About Me

![](<../.gitbook/assets/IMG_0016~2 (2).jpg>)

Hi, I'm Sanjay.&#x20;

Trying to figure out the world around me and myself in the process.&#x20;

I'm interested in a lot of things, so it's a bit difficult for me to articulate it into a few sentences. I consider myself a work in progress. Learning, unlearning and relearning.&#x20;

Actively involved in communities and projects since college. Loves art, music, food, travel, books and movies. Above all good conversations with good people.&#x20;

~~Working as product manager~~ Leading the product team at Entri App. (It has been and is a wonderful journey, in 2021 I was an intern and in 2024 I am leading the team. My mentor, boss and friend [Rahul Ramesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecoderdotin/) is the sole driving force behind this growth. When everyone wants us to settle with the safe options, there are people who push us to the limits and in the process make us more capable.)&#x20;
