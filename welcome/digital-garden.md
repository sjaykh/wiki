# 🌿 Digital Garden

The things about thoughts and ideas atleast for me, they keep on making me restless unless and until I scribble it somewhere. Usually this happened and still happens as sketches and notes in a sheet of paper or notebook. I have had a hard time keeping track of these notes. അപ്പോളാണ് എന്റെ സുഹൃത്ത് [ഹൃഷി](https://stultus.in/), ഡിജിറ്റൽ ഗാർഡൻ‌ റെക്കമെന്റ് ചെയ്‌തത്‌.

The inspiration for me to start this space was [Hrishikesh Bhaskaran](https://stultus.in/) and his [digital garden](https://wiki.stultus.in/).

[Mehar ji's Kinassery ](https://wiki.meharmp.in/)keeps me motivated to keep contributing and grow this garden.&#x20;

> In basic terms, it is a different format for written content on the web. It’s about moving away from blog posts ordered by dates and categories, into more of an interlinked web of notes. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document. [Digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) are also known as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or Second Brain.&#x20;
