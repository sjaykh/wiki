# Do not ask your children to strive for extraordinary lives

_Do not ask your children_

_to strive for extraordinary lives._&#x20;

_Such striving may seem admirable,_

_but it is the way of foolishness._&#x20;

_Help them instead to find the wonder_

_and the marvel of an ordinary life._&#x20;

_Show them the joy of tasting_&#x20;

_tomatoes, apples and pears._&#x20;

_Show them how to cry_

_when pets and people die._&#x20;

_Show them the infinite pleasure_

_in the touch of a hand._&#x20;

_And make the ordinary come alive for them._&#x20;

_The extraordinary will take care of itself._
