# The Riddle of Strider

_All that is gold does not glitter,_\
_Not all those who wander are lost;_\
_The old that is strong does not wither,_\
_Deep roots are not reached by the frost._\
_From the ashes a fire shall be woken,_\
_A light from the shadows shall spring;_\
_Renewed shall be_ [_blade that was broken_](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/And%C3%BAril)_,_\
_The crownless again shall be_ [_king_](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kings\_of\_Gondor)_._
