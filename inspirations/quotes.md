* What most people who've found breakthrough success have in common is that they weren't trying to aim for breakthrough success.  \
  So, what were they doing instead? They were sniffing around to discover and follow the path they deemed most interesting. This obviously isn't guaranteed to give success either. There are lots of things we find interesting that don't amount to much (in fact, that's the default case). But, by following the gradient of interestingness, you're increasing your chances of stumbling upon success
*   **People only really learn when they‚Äôre surprised.** If they‚Äôre not surprised, then what you told them just fits in with what they already know. No minds were changed. No new perspective. Just more information.

    So my main advice to anyone preparing to give a talk on stage is to cut out everything from your talk that‚Äôs not surprising. (Nobody has ever complained that a talk was too short.)

    **Use this rule in all your public writing.** If you already found something surprising in what you‚Äôre presenting, then remove everything else. If you haven‚Äôt found something surprising about it yet, keep looking until you do.
* "Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself-and that is what it is when it dies the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn't work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die."
* ‚ÄúNo matter what, expect the unexpected. And whenever possible BE the unexpected.‚Äù  \~Lynda Barry
* Mark Andressen about Elon Musk
  * Elon inspires incredible loyalty from his employees because they know he'll sit all night with them to solve a problem.‚ÄúElon actually delegates almost everything. He's not involved in most of the things that his companies are doing. He's involved in the thing that is the biggest problem right now until that thing is fixed. And then, he doesn't have to be involved in it anymore, he can go focus on the next thing that's the biggest problem for that company right now.
  * In any manufacturing chain, there's always some bottleneck, something that is keeping the manufacturing line from running the way that it's supposed to. Whatever the bottleneck, it's holding everything up. The job number one is to remove that bottleneck and get everything flowing again. I think Elon basically has universalized that concept and he basically looks at every company like it's some sort of conceptual assembly line. I don't need to manage everything else because everything else, by definition, is running better than that. I can go focus on that.
  * He's not asking the VP of Engineering to ask the Director of Engineering to ask the manager to ask the individual contributor to write a report that's to be reviewed in three weeks. He doesn't do that. He would throw them all out of the window. There's just no way he would do that. He goes and personally finds the engineer who actually has the knowledge about the thing, and then he sits in the room with that engineer and fixes the problem with them.
* But again, I think that patience, more than anything else, is necessary if you want to establish and maintain a writing life. Patience is what will keep you working over the long term, help you maintain your faith in your work and grow into your ambitions. Patience is what you need in order to rest and then return to your toughest project, that book you want to write, when you‚Äôre at the end of a week or a month of bad writing days, alone at your desk, without peers or teachers or anyone who can do the work with you, and there is no guarantee that you will finish what you‚Äôve begun or convince others to see its potential. If you have the patience to write after and through times like that, you‚Äôll have made it a habit‚Äîsomething you can do from muscle memory‚Äîand hopefully, you can keep showing up for yourself and your work for years to come.
* "I figured I'd probably write 50 scripts in my life. Out of those 50, I figured maybe five would be produced, and that maybe one or two would be successful. So I always kind of expected I'd write at least one successful film in my life. \[...] The way it all came together was kind of like [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law) in reverse‚ÄîI don't expect that kind of experience again any time soon." \~Michael Arndt
* "Lebenslanger Schicksalsschatz" is not something that develops over time. It is something that happens instantaneously. It courses through you like the water of a river after a storm, filling you and emptying you all at once. You feel it throughout your body, in your hands, in your heart, in your stomach, in your skin... have you ever felt this way about someone?" - Klaus in Farmhampton episode, HIMYM
* "I had this beautiful little domain. It was all mine. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even."
* ‚ÄòWhen death finds you, may it find you alive.‚Äô
* ‚ÄúSometimes love means taking a step back. If you care about somebody, you should want them to be happy even if you wind up being left out.‚Äù -Ted Mosby
* Dreaming is free. You can‚Äôt be stingy with dreams
* Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to remove.
* "You have enemies? Why, it is the story of every man who has done a great deed or created a new idea. It is the cloud which thunders around everything that shines. Fame must have enemies, as light must have gnats. Do not bother yourself about it; disdain. Keep your mind serene as you keep your life clear." -Victor Hugo
* ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt leave you on read. You left them speechless‚Äù ‚Äî future.
* I am out with lanterns, looking for myself.
* [This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu4lf5Vw_Q) is relatable especially for people who don‚Äôt know what it looks like when most of their lives is all about yelling, screaming, criticism, and low self worth. I cried because hearing her words it‚Äôs so beautiful but to people who don‚Äôt know that feeling of genuine love it‚Äôs so hard to accept that we deserve too and bear in this moment catastrophizes relationships and pushes away. Made me realize bear to me personally I am deserving of that.
* "Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed pope mobiles through the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in Hard Rock Cafes and McDonalds? Or do we want to eat without fear, tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat, the sincerely offered gift of a lightly grilled fish head? I know what I want. I want it all. I want to try everything once." \~Anthony Bourdain
* "To be a scientist is to be naive. We are so focused on our search for the truth we fail to consider how few actually want us to find it" - Valery Legasov
* You will now confront one of modern society‚Äôs ever-present dangers, which is the risk of distraction we face whenever nothing interesting happens for a few minutes.
* "You should never turn a man's generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him." \~Rabi to Feynman
* "Anybody who cares less about wanting to be cool, I think, is more interesting." \~Aimee Mann
* "Short words are best and the old words when short are best of all." \~Winston Churchill
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kind of person who likes to be by himself. To put a finer point on it, I‚Äôm the type of person who doesn‚Äôt find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring. I‚Äôve had this tendency ever since I was young, when, given a choice, I much preferred reading books on my own or concentrating on listening to music over being with someone else. I could always think of things to do by myself.‚Äù \~Haruki Murakami
* "We are the masters of the unsaid words, but slaves of those we let slip out." \~Churchill
* ‚ÄúI can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.‚Äù \~Sylvia Plath

* "India is a country where if we shared notes, we think we could not score good marks. This is the zero-sum mindset we have. In entrepreneurship, we could all become extremely wealthy by sharing notes." \~Kunal Shah
* "For a successful technology," Feynman concluded, "reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."
* "Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics." \~first paragraph of David Goldstein's States of Matter
* <mark style="background-color:green;">"More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions." \~Patrick Collison</mark>
* "Steve used to say to me ‚Äî and he used to say this a lot ‚Äî 'Hey Jony, here‚Äôs a dopey idea.' And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room and they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet simple ones, which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished." \~Jony Ive
* ‚ÄúDo not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise; seek what they sought.‚Äù \~Matsuo Basho
* "When you reach out to other people, half the time they don‚Äôt respond, but half the time they do. It‚Äôs asymmetric; it doesn‚Äôt really cost too much when they don‚Äôt, and it can be incredibly rewarding when they do. If I did not do that, I would have missed out on a huge amount." \~Patrick Collison
* "There is a difference between knowing the path & walking the path" \~Morpheus, The Matrix
* ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt begin to tell you the things I discovered while I was looking for something else.‚Äù \~Shelby Foote
* ‚ÄúIt is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.‚Äù \~H. S. Truman
* <mark style="background-color:green;">‚ÄúI would never again be made a foot soldier in a conflict I did not understand.‚Äù \~Tara Westover</mark>
* ‚ÄúThe past was a ghost, insubstantial, unaffecting. Only the future had weight.‚Äù \~Tara Westover
* <mark style="background-color:green;">‚ÄúI wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.‚Äù \~Andy Bernard(Nard Dog)</mark>
* ‚ÄúWhen you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it. The minute you understand that you can poke life and that if you push something in, something will pop out the other side. That you can change it and you can mold it‚Ä¶that may be the most important thing, to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you‚Äôre just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.‚Äù \~Steve Jobs
* ‚ÄúDon't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.‚Äù \~George S. Patton
* "You've got to be a really good talent scout because no matter how smart you are, you need a team of great people. You've got to figure out how to size people up fairly quickly, make decisions without knowing people too well and hire them and see how you do and refine your intuition ... because you need great people around you." \~Steve Jobs
* ‚ÄúIt could be tedious, sleep-inducing work. So I came up with an idea. I‚Äôd send a box of Girl Scout Thin Mints with every paper that needed to be reviewed. 'Thank you for agreeing to do this,' I‚Äôd write. 'The enclosed Thin Mints are your reward. But no fair eating them until you review the paper.'‚Äù \~Randy Pausch
* ‚ÄúOthers, like Richard Feynman, the theoretical physicist, manage never to lose their ability to come up with fresh ideas. In other words, they learn to nurture their unconscious, and to trust it. Feynman spent a lot of time playing the drums. The great mathematician John Conway spent much of his time playing games. Playing...keeps you ‚Äòfresh.‚Äô‚Äù \~John Cleese
* ‚ÄúIt usually takes more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech." \~Mark Twain
* ‚ÄúStrong opinions, kindly held, never yelled." \~Shreyas Doshi
* "If you want to build a ship, don‚Äôt drum people up together to collect wood, and don‚Äôt assign them tasks and work. Rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." \~Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
* "Design like you're right; listen like you're wrong." \~John Lilly
* "The sensible answer is to listen, absorb, discuss, be able to defend any design decision with clarity and reason, know when to pick your battles and know when to let go." \~Speider Schneider
* ‚ÄúWe should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.‚Äù \~Mark Twain
* ‚ÄúIf you have nothing to say, say nothing.‚Äù \~Mark Twain
* "You would not believe how difficult it is to be simple and clear. People are afraid that they may be seen as a simpleton. In reality, just the opposite is true." \~Jack Welch
* ‚ÄúSteve Jobs has a saying that A players hire A players; B players hire C players; and C players hire D players. It doesn't take long to get to Z players. This trickle-down effect causes bozo explosions in companies.‚Äù \~Guy Kawasaki
* ‚ÄúSimplicity is the zenith of a long, arduous journey, not the starting point.‚Äù \~Rolf Dobelli
* "You have to stick within what I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and what you don't understand. It's not terribly important how big the circle is. But it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is." \~Charlie Munger
* "Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward." \~Charlie Munger
* "My biggest punishment, my biggest revenge on you is, I‚Äôm gonna make you run this company long term. You had the baby, now you gotta raise the child. And you‚Äôre stuck with it for 18 years. I knew he wanted to sell the company.. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo, no. You‚Äôre running this company.‚Äù And I knew he maybe could move faster than me for a year, but he wasn‚Äôt gonna keep doing it. And so that was our strategy. We built the company for the long term." \~Brian Chesky
* "When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it? Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it." \~Leo Tolstoy
* ‚ÄúIn my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time -- none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads--and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.‚Äù \~Charlie Munger
* <mark style="background-color:green;">‚ÄúI wanted to be in politics but not of politics.‚Äù \~Obama</mark>
* ‚ÄúThat was something my mother made sure I understood. Once, she found out that I had been part of a group teasing a kid at school. She sat me down and told me that there were two kinds of people in the world: Those who only think about themselves and tear others down to make themselves feel important. And those who think about how others feel and avoid doing things that might hurt them. 'So,' she asked me, 'Which kind of person do you want to be?'‚Äù \~Obama
* ‚ÄúI can read about what it was like to lose everything during the Great Depression. But I don‚Äôt have the emotional scars of those who actually experienced it. And the person who lived through it can‚Äôt fathom why someone like me could come across as complacent about things like owning stocks. We see the world through a different lens.‚Äù \~Morgan Housel
* ‚ÄúThere was an owl liv'd in an oak The more he heard, the less he spoke The less he spoke, the more he heard. O, if men were all like that wise bird."
* "Most people, when confronted with something they don‚Äôt understand, do not realize they don‚Äôt understand it because they‚Äôre able to come up with an explanation that makes sense based on their own unique perspective and experiences in the world, however limited those experiences are. We all want the complicated world we live in to make sense. So we tell ourselves stories to fill in the gaps of what are effectively blind spots." \~Morgan Housel
* <mark style="background-color:green;">‚ÄúThe world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.‚Äù \~Sherlock Holmes</mark>
* ‚ÄúA genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.‚Äù \~Napoleon
* "History is just one damned thing after another."
* ‚ÄúRevolutions can, and often have, begun with reading." \~Arundathi Roy

* "Life is not always black and white, it's a million shades of grey." \~Ridley Scott
* "When you are peeling an orange, just peel it with all your heart, and nothing else. When you are watching a film, don't think of what to make for dinner tonight. When you are eating a mango, forget strawberries, your mother-in-law and your impending tax returns. When you put a piece of dark chocolate in your mouth, think of nothing but the smile on your face. When you're tasting a long and slow kiss, don't worry if you've got on the perfect underwear. In the midst of making love, don't ponder how long a relationship will last. When driving on a highway, keep your mind on the road. In the middle of a beautiful dream, don't try to memorise it. Forget all they told you about multi-tasking and time management. If you're not living in the now, you're just not living, period."

* <mark style="background-color:green;">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn‚Äôt that kind of the point?‚Äù \~The Office.</mark>
* ‚ÄúStorming a breach, conducting an embassy, ruling a nation are glittering deeds. Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together gently and justly with your household ‚Äì and with yourself ‚Äì not getting slack nor being false to yourself, is something more remarkable, more rare and more difficult. Whatever people may say, such secluded lives sustain in that way duties which are at least as hard and as tense as those of other lives.‚Äù \~Montaigne
* ‚ÄúThat's what I would call equanimity, or equilibrium, and it's the kind of state of mind that cannot be perfumed in any way by anything that happens outside you. This kind of confidence that comes from there is like the confidence of the sky. Right now it's dark outside, but you know if you went up in a plane, even in the stormiest of days, the sky's brilliant blue underneath. When you look at the sky, and it's made a rainbow, and it's absolutely gorgeous, there's no question that the sky's up there going, ‚ÄòHa, did you see my rainbow?‚Äô Or when it's a terrible, bleak, you know, gray, gloomy day, that the sky's going to apologize. No, the sky just is, because the sky sees the impermanence of the clouds, and the impermanence of the rainbows, and you have to develop an inner state of mind that's as impervious to all the good shit and bad shit that happens to you as the sky is to the weather.‚Äù \~Caroline McHugh
* ‚ÄúAnd I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.‚Äù \~Celeste Headlee
* ‚Äú1. Don‚Äôt multitask - be present with mind. 2. Enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. Don‚Äôt just try to get your point across. Everybody is an expert in some thing. 3. Use open ended questions. Who what when where why how. 4. Go with the flow. Thoughts will come into your mind and go out of your mind. Let them go. Don‚Äôt think for two minutes about a clever question to ask. 5. If you don‚Äôt know say that you don‚Äôt know. 6. Don‚Äôt equate your experience with theirs. It is never the same. It‚Äôs not about you. Don‚Äôt take that moment. Conversations are not A promotional opportunity. 7. Try not to repeat yourself. 8. Stay out of the weeds. People don‚Äôt care about the years the names The dates all those details. 9. Listen. Buddha: if your mouth is open you‚Äôre not learning. Calvin Coolidge: no man ever listened his way out of a job. We don‚Äôt listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply. 10. Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.‚Äù \~Celeste Headlee

* ‚ÄúYou yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection" \~Sharon Salzberg
* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal enough to hold out for all that we want. Why would we celebrate hobbling, when we wish to run? Why accept friendship, when we crave passion? But if we reach the end of the day and no one has died, no further limbs have broken, a few lines have been written and one or two encouraging and pleasant things have been said, then that is already an achievement worthy of a place at the altar of sanity. How natural and tempting to put one‚Äôs faith in the bountifulness of the years, but how much wiser it might be to bring all one‚Äôs faculties of appreciation and love to bear on that most modest and most easily-dismissed of increments: the day already in hand."

* ‚ÄúA note of warning, almost everything exciting becomes less so eventually, so it's probably not smart to put all your eggs in one basket. When one wears out, another will take its place. If you expect to receive all happiness from one pursuit, you may feel like a failure as a human when it no longer floats your boat. This is definitely not the case though."
* ‚ÄúLastly, learn to love imperfection. I believe that romanticism, the requirement of perfect, untarnished ideals in an imperfect, tarnished world, is chief amongst all sources of misery. Whether it's yourself, the people you love, the companies you've started, the heroes you've chosen, the spouse you've linked with or the children you've raised, be ok with any and all of them disappointing you at one point or another. The world is a gritty place of incomplete people and non existent wholes. It is the world you live in and the only one you'll get. Learn to love it. Really. Somehow. Please. Embrace its imperfections and distance yourself from people who force their romantic ideals upon you. Misery loves company. Free yourself from the clinging need, accept value in darkness and live with dignity. Find good in the bad, not bad in the good. Somewhere in there is the closest I've come to understanding happiness."
* ‚ÄúYou cannot steer a parked car."
* "Genius is knowing when to stop."
* "It's no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. Go towards positivity like a plant turns towards the sun. You can fight darkness by turning away from it. Your feelings inform you what is light and what is dark. One day at a time. You are not alone."
* "I highly suggest travelling on your own if you've never done so. Do whatever you want whenever you want. It's very likely liberating and you end up meeting a lot of people that you might not have met if you were hanging with your friends."
* "The problem is many people view disapproval as something that CAN BE AVOIDED. Guess what! It cannot be avoided. LeBron James, one of the greatest basketball players of our time receives disapproval. Jesus Christ, one of the most influential human beings in history received disapproval. The point is, NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE....you will receive disapproval. SO EMBRACE IT. Talk to that girl,write that blog, move to that city, START THAT BUSINESS! Sure you might fail, and god forbid someone might disapprove of the action you take....SO WHAT. You now know that like the air you breath disapproval is A CONSTANT. It cannot be avoided, and therefore it should be your friend. Ask yourself who are the people you admire in this society? Is it the student who seeks the teacher's approval? Is it the person who accepts a menial day job because it's "safe" and very likely to get society's stamp of approval. You don't admire these people! You admire the risk taker! You admire the person that's willing to say what they want to say REGARDLESS OF DISAPPROVAL. You admire the entrepreneur who starts a business even though failure is imminent. It's the people who are living unapologetically the way they want BECAUSE THEY WANT TO....those are the people we love. Start being the person you admire...love yourself. Just remember, disapproval is a constant you must embrace. Live life on your standards, your reality...your rules. Go for what you want in life, not for other's approval, but for your own intrinsic satisfaction. Who gives a shit if people don't like what you say or do....accept their disapproval, AND DO IT ANYWAYS."
* " Everybody wants friends and to be loved as much as you do.
  * People are just as self-conscious, anxious, and worried as you are.
  * Be kind, people are fragile.
  * Everyone else has a voice inside them too.
  * Not everyone has to like you.
  * Don't worry, there's someone out there who will though.
  * The more you do and live and risk, the more interesting you become to others.
  * Don't be afraid to make yourself look silly or dumb, people tend to like people who put themselves out there. It's better to take risks.
  * Be flexible, be willing to change your mind and hear others out.
  * Everyone is going through their own problems.
  * Don't be a snot.
  * Everyone is talented/intelligent in their own way - just because you are smart academically and intellectual doesn't mean that you mean more than others.
  * Don't be a pushover, stand up for yourself. People will still like you.
  * Don't dwell.
  * Stop being so anxious."
* "John Greenleaf Whittier wrote in his poem, ‚ÄúMaud Muller‚Äù, ‚ÄúOf the saddest words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: It Might Have Been.‚Äù Don‚Äôt let that be true of you. Not because of your lost love but because of the lost loves and good times you could have had if only you were not wasting your life in regret and self-recrimination. Strive to find joy. Because the truth of the matter is this: if there must be an absence of pain for joy to exist then we are all doomed. We must find a way to experience joy despite our pain. Everybody hurts. Everybody. But many, if not most, find a way to move on despite their pain and find some joy in life and not just find that joy but seek it out and squeeze all they can from it. That‚Äôs what you have to do also. You hurt. Ok. I get it. Now what? Get moving. Improve your life and make yourself better for the next great opportunity. Or as Morgan Freeman says, ‚ÄúGet busy living or get busy dying.‚Äù When you waste your time in regret you are just committing slow motion suicide. Don‚Äôt do it."
* "Progress isn't always a straight line."
* "My friend, you are not bored with life. You are bored with what you are making of your life. Look out there, for just five seconds. See the trees, the houses, the streets, the people. Out there are whole worlds to discover. There are arts to master. There are great works of fiction or memory to be read which will shake your inner core in ways you have never felt before. Life is not boring. What we make of this life often is. If your life consists of school, internet, an occasional meeting with friends, homework, eating, sleeping, masturbation, some sport and games - well, of course life is boring. What does it mean to say something is boring? It is without stimulation, without novelty and change. But this planet alone is so huge that you could spend twenty lifetimes and you would still not have seen everything there is to see in this world. There are so many wise and funny and crazy and beautiful and insightful and normal people to meet, so many countries to visit, foods to try, people to help, landscapes to admire - this world is huge. If you want to be not bored you can make your world not-boring by engaging with more of the world out there. You are not bored with life or the world. You are bored because you have made your life and your world very small. You are living in a small, sheltered bubble, chained by TVs and games and what feels like duties, to stay in this bubble. But you are bored. Why are you bored? Because you know that the life you are living is too small for you. Sleeping through the weekend is too small for you. Going to school, then home is too small for you. Playing computer games and watching movies is too small for you. Maybe even the people around you are too small for you. What you are missing is to go out and try new things. Oh, that's an effort? And you don't know how to get there? Well, fuck that, do it anyway. Get on the greyhound or whatever your countries' equivalent of cheap transport is, and go to a place you've not been before. Your smartphone has connection to amazing travel guides. Your camera in one hand, your smartphone (or better: a printed guide) in the other hand you can go and discover new worlds. Is there a big forest nearby? Get one or two good friends, a tent, sleeping bags and go, do it, just camp out in the woods for a weekend. Find out what it's like to poo in a hole and live from dry and cold food - or how to make a fire (don't burn the forest). Your life is boring you, not because the world is small, but because your world is small. You have a choice: Keep doing what is easy, the things you know, the things you have done before, the things that you are sure will be fun and safe. Do something different every day. Walk through the city at night. Lay in an open field and try to count the stars. Dare to try new things even if you look stupid. Be the guy that follows his ideas and that drags others along, rather than the one that waits for others to suggest things. One of those versions you've tried. One of those choices bores you. The other one scares you. It is your choice: Remain bored or dare to do things you haven't done before. Your life will not be interesting unless you make it interesting."
* "Being happy. It‚Äôs not one big thing for me but several: Know yourself. Come to terms with who you are as a person, the role you play in others‚Äô lives, and what your personal goals and priorities are. Admit your flaws to yourself and then focus on your strengths, building them up, and playing to them. Stop worrying about things that have happened or that might happen. Focus on today and tomorrow each day. Control what you can. Invest in yourself and in things that cannot be taken away from you. These include health, knowledge, experiences, education/training, as well as tangible items. Getting out of debt or minimizing debt really does make you feel more free. Treat other people the way you want to be treated. Be polite and respectful to others. Try to make other people smile and laugh and you will be amazed how much more you will find yourself smiling and laughing. Be the adult. Don‚Äôt take shit from people. When people are giving you shit, call them out on it in the way a coach or teacher would. ‚ÄúDeborah, that‚Äôs not a respectful or professional tone and it doesn‚Äôt do any of us any good for you to speak that way. We are never going to finish this project if we can‚Äôt communicate and cooperate. We need to be a team and we can‚Äôt afford to cut each other down.‚Äù Be more decisive. The only way you learn to be more decisive is to start making decisions and communicating them. People treat you differently when you act decisively. Find things that amuse you and do them often. I like to drop quotes from classic comedies in otherwise serious situations and see who else in the room smiles. This kind of ties in to #4 and I do it multiple times per day. I also enjoy people watching and getting people to try new foods. Put yourself first. I don‚Äôt mean be selfish or self-centered. I mean don‚Äôt do things that are bad for you to please other people. Don‚Äôt sacrifice your own sanity or safety or time or money for other people unless they really, really, really deserve it. It‚Äôs ok to look out for yourself and you shouldn‚Äôt apologize for it. Plus, you‚Äôre not able to help others until you have some stability yourself. Stop worrying. Everyone wants you scared, confused, or in some way dependent so they can control you. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Stop consuming so much media and get outside more. Stop browsing Reddit and go to a play or a sporting event. Just stop letting outside forces make you think about and worry about shit you can‚Äôt control."
* "Carl Sagan. I realized that if I say I'm bored, it's like slapping Mother Earth in the face and telling her what she's offered me isn't good enough. That I need more, better. The universe is infinite outward and your mind is infinite inward. There is never a moment to be bored."
* "Here's what I do. I stop drinking alcohol at 6pm on Sundays. I try to get, no less, than eight hours of sleep each night. I put everything I need in the morning out the night before (toothpaste, floss etc). I have my clothes laying out in the bathroom. My shoes are in the bathroom. While getting ready I listen to music in the morning. Not news. I take my dogs out for a leisurly walk. I listen to music on my drive to work. Not the news. I work at a job I love (31 years). I go home to a wife I love and walk the dogs I love. I don't drink Monday-Thursday. This works for me. By the way, I make less money than the national average. I'm still happy every day. You can be too. You just have to decide that that is how your going to see your life. There will always be someone better off and worse off than you are. Enjoy the days one at a time."
* "So to those who are constantly depressed or maybe just stuck in a rut, give yourself a break. You are worth your life, and life is precious. Protect yours, engage in yours, do the things that make you happy and enrich those around you. Life is fleeting, life is ugly, life is hard, but God Damnit can life be beautiful. If you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, then try to change the scenery, you are worth being happy."
* "One small change that helped my perspective was to replace "I'm sorry" with "Thank you". For example, instead of saying "Sorry I'm late" , say " thank you for waiting for me" and that sort of thing. It made me realize how many little things I have to be thankful for each day :)"
* "Constantly plan for events or occurrences that are outside of your day to day. It can be big like travelling to another country or as small as picking up a new video game. I find the constant anticipation to eventually meeting your goal is what gives me that high of enjoying life."
* "Enjoying little things no matter how insignificant they seem. Like really savoring that first sip of hot cocoa, listening to the wind blow through the trees and how it makes the branches click together, enjoying the feel of my pets fur as I brush them, the hypnotic sound of pencil writing on paper. Life can be very mundane, but if you slow down sometimes you can find joy in the smallest of things. This! I have a garden in my backyard. God are gardens great for the small moments. Sometimes we get butterflies, sometimes we get hummingbirds! Week to week or even day to day, you see changes. You can see the flowers forming on your plants. You can see your veggies getting big, flowering, fruiting, and ripening. There's so much magic going on with just air, sunlight, and a little water."

1. Enjoy time spent alone. Being alone is scary for a lot of people. A lot especially don't know how to be alone with their thoughts. You don't need to isolate yourself or avoid people, but just be able to handle not having somebody to immediately talk to at all hours of the day. You'll end up finding you can actually enjoy yourself alone in ways you can't with the noise of company.
2. Maintain meaningful relationships. You shouldn't rely on others specifically to make you happy, but just enjoy the people you talk to. Make friends, pay attention to them, listen to them and gain enjoyment from hearing about their lives. Equally, share your own lives with people whom are happy to listen to you. Such moments day-to-day won't necessarily give your life meaning, but it'll keep up your mood.
3. Be a generally friendly person. If the same guy brings you your pizza each time, learn his name. Remembering him has 'Pete' rather than 'The pizza guy' can make even a small interaction be another small up in your day. You don't necessarily have to 'trust' everyone you meet, but by assuming the best in people when you can, and treating them that way, a lot of people will return that sentiment.
4. Take care of your body. Basic exercise, a proper diet, and a consistent sleep schedule, do a lot. A lot of it is just hormonal as well, when your body chemistry is in balance it positively affects other parts of your life as well. A bonus is that if you look healthy and feel well-rested, it'll positively impact your self-confidence and self-image.
5. Have some hobbies and enjoy them to their fullest. Enjoy learning more about them, and getting better at them. Don't compare yourself to others, only yourself. Being better each day than you were before is really rewarding; reminding yourself you're not as good as others is a pointless endeavor that only damages motivation.
6. Pour effort into anything worth doing. In your actual job, or your personal things, if you're actually taking the time to do something, do it properly. Not for anybody else's sake, but just to know you've done your best. Knowing you're half-assing your work and wasting your potential each day will just wear you down.
7. Explore yourself. Find a new hobby, meet a new person, try a few food, play a game, watch a movie, read a book, go to a new place. No matter what you do, being willing to explore new things means you always have an opportunity to find something you didn't know you loved. It also helps you fill your life with small fun things.
8. If you spend a lot of time in a specific area, try to make it aesthetically pleasing if possible. Perhaps your home, or your workspace, or anything. If you have to spend 8 hours in the same gray space everyday, eventually it'll affect your mood. But seeing some small colourful things can just be a little thing to keep your day going.
9. Change your attitude. Behind ever gray cloud is a silver lining. Behind every mistake is a change to grow. Behind every missed chance, is an opportunity for something new. Being willing to see things in a positive light, and to just enjoy the little things in your day, will really make a difference to your day-to-day. Even if you know the day is bad, see it as a positive day overall in some small way, and don't let it get to you. It's not a crime to take care of yourself or want to be happy. It doesn't matter it's selfish or if you deserve it or not. If you want to live a life you can be happy to live, then do so. Make small but consistent changes each day, and watch them build up to the life you really want.

* ‚ÄúSeek greater understanding, but do not expect greater detail. There are many who, by virtue of their passivity, dependency, fear and laziness, seek to be shown every inch of the way and have it demonstrated to them that each step will be safe and worth their while. This cannot be done. For the journey of spiritual growth requires courage and initiative and independence of thought and action. While the words of the prophets and the assistance of grace are available, the journey must still be traveled alone. No teacher can carry you there. There are preset formulas. Rituals are only learning aids, they are not the learning. Eating organic food, saying five Hail Mary's before breakfast, praying facing east or west, or going to church on Sunday will not take you to your destination. No words can be said, no teaching can be taught that will relieve spiritual travelers from the necessity of picking their own ways, working out with effort and anxiety their own paths through the unique circumstances of their own lives toward the identification of their individual selves with God." \~Scott Peck, The road less traveled.

I wrote letters to myself. Your turn.‚Äù \~Sankho Kun
* ‚ÄúThe life you're used to and the body you control are not the full scope of the organism of which you are a part. You are 100 trillion cells in each of 6 billion human beings. your cousins, a thousand times as numerous, are cells comprising the tissues and organs that make ants work. The other 99.9% of you is bacteria, and you've been here for 4 billion years. You are older than the mountains, older than the asteroid belt. And during this 4 billion years, you have never died. Not all of you. Not once. Some parts of you became damaged and were lost, but you carried on. If your parents hadn't made it, you wouldn't be here right now. During this 4 billion years we transformed a hostile world into a comfortable one. Or it transformed us. We made the atmosphere breathable and we adapted to breathe it. We made fur, and later, we made other parts of us make fur for the human parts. And the human part of you made tools. Rocket tools that will be of use to all of us very soon. With the help of this human organ, your cellular descendants will leap off this mote of dust into the vast sea of resources beyond. A sea that can support us hundreds of trillions of times more richly than our current home. A sea for our home, to make liveable or to force us to adapt again, as Earth once did. Rejoice, human, and keep moving forward! You're on to something very big for all of us, though you may not yet know it. We will all reap the rewards of your efforts, soon.‚Äù

* "I'm 26 years old, and I've spent my whole life waiting for something else to start. Now I realize that this is all there is, and I'm going to try to live my life like that. I have this theory that your body goes through puberty in its teens, and the mind goes through puberty in your twenties"
* ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been taught from such a young age that happiness is meant to be this big, all consuming thing. That it is this moment that cracks us open, and sweeps all of the weight inside of us away. That it is something we‚Äôre always in pursuit of until we find it. And so we are always waiting for happiness ‚Äî this simplifying in life, this ‚Äòaha‚Äô moment where the wounds are healed and the growth is organized neatly within our ribcage and our hearts aren‚Äôt afraid and the warmth never leaves. But I don‚Äôt think happiness is big, or infinite at all. I think real happiness exists in the acceptance of the fact that we will always be balancing what is light and dark within ourselves. It exists in the quiet, in the small things. In a morning cup of coffee, in the sound of your mothers voice. I think real happiness is believing that you are meant to be here, that you are meant to take up space. I think real happiness is finding the human beings who take care of you ‚Äî not in a materialistic way, but rather, finding those who take care of your soul, those who truly see you. I think real happiness is all around you, at all times, pinned and blooming in the things you stopped paying attention to because you were always searching for more. Flowers on your walk to work. The intensity in the air when you meet someone and you know they‚Äôre going to change your life. The way your stomach flips when you hear your favourite song, or when you hold the person who fills you with the sunniest kind of hope."
* "I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school, and you helped me. Even if you didn't know what I was talking about or know someone who's gone through it, you made me not feel alone. Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite." \~Perks of Being a Wallflower
* "We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope"
* "I‚Äôm an introvert. At least I think I am. Sometimes I surprise myself with some sort of extroverted gesture that I then often regret and will overthink it retrospectively and feel <mark style="background-color:green;">anxious that I shouldn‚Äôt have expressed my extroverted side and instantly regret it. I‚Äôm obsessive. If I discover a book or movie or song or artist that I instantly fall in love with I will read, or watch or listen or stare obsessively at for days or weeks until my every thought is consumed by this thing. I hide. I hide from people, situations, confrontation and often myself. I escape. Always into a book, and feel free from every anxiety, every awkward one sided conversation, every regret, every fear of failure. And finally, I am a dreamer. I dream of being an author, or poet or script writer that writes something that maybe, just maybe, some other introvert somewhere can get obsessive about, or escape into when they want to hide from the world‚Ä¶.. just like me." \~@paperplanesundays</mark>

*   <mark style="background-color:green;">Writing is a strange craft. Because so many of us are literate, we feel writing</mark> _<mark style="background-color:green;">stories</mark>_ <mark style="background-color:green;">should come really naturally, and if you struggle, it's just because you're a naturally bad writer.</mark>

    <mark style="background-color:green;">It's not the case. Writing stories takes as much study and practice as painting or playing an instrument. How many books have you read about writing scripts or prose fiction? How many stories - good, bad, ugly - have you finished, shared and received feedback and/or instruction on? Are you cut out for this? It's really a question of how much you want it, and whether your work ethic matches that.</mark>
* "Oh no, I want to write but I believe I suck at it."
  1. If you believe you suck so much, why don‚Äôt you get better by writing and learning along the way?
  2. How do you learn? For starters check your own writing. Is there something off you think it can improve? It can‚Äôt all be so bad. Some bits have to be keepers. As for the rest that cause you nausea, how do they differ from your favorite authors? What do other people think about them?
  3. What? You think everything you write is bad? Not even a single tiny bit is passable? Then make it good by going back to tip #1. Or at least have a positive mindset. Who said your writing has to be good in order for people to like it? Lots of bad books are very popular. Corny, derivative, schlocky nonsense has its audience and it‚Äôs big.
  4. I said audience, didn‚Äôt I? If you think you suck so much, why don‚Äôt you check what sells out there? Maybe your mom and your cousin George think they are the spawns of the devil, but what about the others out there? Maybe you are not showing your work to the proper people. Take young adult or light novels for example. Most of them are meh or worse, yet they are doing well. Because they are written for a certain audience that doesn‚Äôt include your mom or your cousin George. So keep writing. There is bound to be an audience even for the trash fire you are making.
  5. I keep saying you are bad at writing, don‚Äôt I? Why should you be bad? Do you by any chance want to be good instead of bad? Then go back to tip #1. Or at least stop worrying so much. A badly written story can be improved. A story that was not written can only be written or go to waste. It‚Äôs about persistence, you know? If you don‚Äôt persist, it won‚Äôt even be given the chance to be good.
  6. You still think you suck despite of all I said so far? Go berserk and write whatever dribble comes to mind without stopping for a moment to think what the hell you are doing. Just do it like in the Nike commercial. Once you are done, look at what you created. It will probably look like the worst thing in human history. But only because it will be unpolished ideas that need to be fleshed out and calibrated. In any case you don‚Äôt throw them away. You go back to tip #1.
  7. What? You are still here and you still think you suck? What‚Äôs wrong with you? You end up being your own worst enemy, you know? You think those abstract paintings that are given a value of hundreds of millions of dollars are actually worth that much? It‚Äôs just a bunch of lines that some critics said they cost so much because they felt like it (and wanted to make money). Are you really telling me you can‚Äôt draw a couple of lines on a canvas and say it‚Äôs worth a million bucks? Others did it. I can do it too. Why can‚Äôt you?
  8. What‚Äôs this crazy talk about placing value on your writing? Who said it needs to have a price tag? It‚Äôs your writing, it should be priceless to you. If you don‚Äôt value your own creation, why do you expect others to do it for you? Isn‚Äôt it an extension of yourself? Your brainchild? Something you made with hard work and is therefore important to you because you made it? Why does it need to be more than that? And if you think it can get even better so others can like it too, there is always tip #1.
  9. What do you mean you don‚Äôt know what to write despite wanting to? Just you nagging all this time is a story of its own. Look at me, writing all this shit for you. That is also a story of its own. What made me do it? Money and fame? I won‚Äôt get a dime and it will be forgotten in a day. I made it because I wanted to make it and I wasn‚Äôt nagging on the internet about not making it. I made it because I wanted it, get it? And here it is. It happened. Because I wanted it. Is it good? Who gives a shit? I had fun writing it.
  10. What? Why are you still reading this? Are you a glutton for punishment? Do you like people saying you are procrastinating or have a loser mentality all this time? Charlie! Charlie, come see this guy on the internet procrastinating and having a loser mentality. There, I just did, are you happy now? What are you going to do about it, wallow in it or go back to the damn first tip? Geez!
