# A love letter to Mumbai

Kochi has always held a special place in my heart. I've wandered its beaches, explored its cafes, and savored meals at its restaurants, so that I can talk about Kochi to everyone and declare my love for it. There's a familiarity to Kochi, that feels like a warm hug.

And then came Mumbai, the city that subtly, silently won me over, a love somehow taking root within me without me even realizing it. Yes, Mumbai is not without its problems. The slums, the glaring disparities – I'm well aware of them. Despite these issues or imperfections, I find myself utterly captivated by Mumbai to the point that I find myself doubting about my feelings for Kochi.

The suburban trains, the Marine Drive, the Gothic architecture, the ever-present kaali peelis, the enchanting night life, the mystique of movie stars, the sheer multitude of events – Mumbai feels vast, taking a different shape at every corner. Each street whispers stories of the past, each building bears the weight of history.

My initial day in Mumbai felt like entering a labyrinth. Afraid and anxious; the city seemed overwhelming, a potential target for theft. I felt all alone in the big city. But as the days went by, the layers of Mumbai began to peel back, revealing a city that wasn't as foreboding as I initially thought.

The suburban trains, in particular, left me awestruck. If Mumbai is the heart, then the suburban network is the intricate web of vessels breathing life into every corner. In those compartments, I saw lovers deep in conversation about their shared future. I saw small children without any care moving through the crowd, professionals immersed in their work amidst the commute. And I saw others like myself, “outsiders” trying to absorb it all. Mumbai's pace is relentless, yet it manages to embrace everyone within its rhythm.

No matter how quickly you walk or how packed your schedule, Mumbai refuses to be ignored. It penetrates your senses, invades your thoughts, and becomes a part of you.

Mumbai has a charm that I find difficult to put into words. I doubt whether I'll ever share this piece publicly, but consider it my personal letter to Mumbai – a tribute to its streets, its structures, its sunsets, and its routines.

To love someone is to embrace them unconditionally, to be in their presence, to accept them as they are, and to encourage introspection while gently pushing them to be a better version. Mumbai nudged me towards introspection. It made me think. Mumbai made me want to leave everything and find a life in it. Mumbai made me feel nostalgic for things, places I have never seen or been before. I hope Mumbai loves me.

As this journey comes to an end, I am sad to leave Mumbai. Mumbai remains a maze I'm still navigating, a person I’m trying to understand. I've walked some paths, had some conversations, but there's much more paths to explore and conversations to have. But right now, I feel like a part of this big place. Like I belong here, I might have a place somewhere here, that I can call home.

Yes, it is easy to get lost in this maze but I feel like I might survive after all, like I can find my way to something and just not be lost. Inspite of all its imperfections Mumbai became beautiful to me, that is when I knew I am in love with Mumbai.
