# the dilemma on whether to act or to wait

Something that has been bothering me for a while is the question of when we want something, should we force it to happen or wait for it to happen?

Most of the time we are told to pursue what we want, no matter the result? Does that work? There is another sect with the argument that if we stop pursuing what we want will happen naturally. In simple terms, the universe will conspire to help us get what we want.

What is the key here? Constantly I am faced with this uncertainty on whether to force something so that I can reach the end goal or to let it be and accept the ambiguity.

The reasoning for the deliberate action is that I don’t regret not doing something in full capacity later in life. Then someone from some spot in my head cries, if it is meant for you then you don’t have to force any action, it will come.

I know there are many things out of our control but shouldn’t we do everything till there is nothing left to do before accepting defeat? Or is it balance between action and inaction, jumping in when you see an opportunity and leaving the rest upto the vagueness, luck or “fate”.

Again what is the key here?

_I guess there are certain frameworks in work and career growth but what about in life?_
