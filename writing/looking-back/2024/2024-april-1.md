Phew! back after a long time.&#x20;

Have been reading, watching a lot.&#x20;

Trying to find joy more. Loved tweaking around with legos, it gave a shit ton of dopamines.

Saw some amazing videos&#x20;

Turning out to be a huge fan of Javed Akhtar, who is a legend. Angry Young Men in Prime Video is a must watch!
