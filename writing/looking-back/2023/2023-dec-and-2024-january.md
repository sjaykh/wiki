# 2023 Dec & 2024 January

Laziness strikes again. But yeah this is me trying to write up stuff that happened over these months.&#x20;

I realised how much I love movies, art, books, travel. Mostly  I kind of live for these stuff I guess. The next movie release is what drives me forward kind of thing. I deeply regret that I am not able to contribute to this craft.&#x20;

Is there an intersection between product management and movie (art in general) I would love to be in that. I would love to contribute, I would love to review and I would love to dissect.

Have been using [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/sjaykh/) heavily and I watched a lot of movies. Even took the letterboxd patron plan.&#x20;

I love this list by Mike Flanagan - [Movies Kate Siegel Hasnâ€™t Seen (but has probably lied and said she totally has)](https://letterboxd.com/flanaganfilm/list/movies-kate-siegel-hasnt-seen-but-has-probably/)

I am trying to read. I have Three body problem and Manushyanu oru aamukham in my mind.

Watched a special preview of Gaganachari and I loved every bit of it. Made me geek out so bad. Made me realise the love I have for movies.&#x20;

Waiting to watch Bramayugam and other movies.&#x20;

I hope life is kind to me and let me enjoy these things while I have the time here. If possible or kind even show me a path towards contributing or being part of something and satisfy the artsy side of me.

I wish I can go back being young with some of this knowlege, I guess I could have tried a bit more and experimented and failed a lot.&#x20;

I wish :) I still have hope that there'll be something out there.&#x20;
