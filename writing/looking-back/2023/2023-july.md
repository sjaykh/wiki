Started drinking more coffee. Davidoff.&#x20;

### Watched

* Oppenheimer
* Barbie

Attended the Barbenheimer as a double feature.&#x20;

Barbie was okay. It was alright. A good movie but nothing about Barbie is going to stick with me forever. For me it felt like just another fun movie.&#x20;

Oppenheimer blew me away. Pieces of that movie is going to stay with me forever.&#x20;

The dialogue and the music.&#x20;

Ludwig is a genius. The whole soundtrack is genius.&#x20;

The whole cast is phenomenal. RDJ deserves an oscar. Emily Blunt amazed me. Literally everyone in every frame was perfect.&#x20;
