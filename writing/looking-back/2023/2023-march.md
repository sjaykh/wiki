# 2023 March

Doing good, being productive. Trying to catch up on a lot especially reading. Still confused on whether or not to invest in a playstation!!&#x20;

Ordered a classic Casio watch.&#x20;

Never really got into the smart watch trend. If I'm investing in one, it would probably be the Apple watch but even those can't beat the look of this Casio.&#x20;

### Listened&#x20;

Discovering a lot of new songs through HIMYM.&#x20;

Started a playlist.&#x20;

HIMYM has a lot of indie songs that feels just right. Real Estate was a great find!!&#x20;

### Watched

The Last of Us is ending. What a show!!&#x20;

Actively watching HIMYM, such a good show. Sitcoms are great...GREAT!!&#x20;

HBO shows are leaving from Disney+ Hoststar. Hope Prime takes those up.&#x20;

Need to rewatch Sopranos and start watching Succession!!&#x20;
