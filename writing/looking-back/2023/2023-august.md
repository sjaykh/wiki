# 2023 August

Travelled to Mumbai. Loved the city. I should plan and travel more.&#x20;

Mumbai made me introspect a lot and I guess I am taking action based on that.&#x20;

The place was amazing and contrary to my usual self, I clicked a lot of photos. I guess those memories are needed. I wrote a [love letter to Mumbai](../../random-thoughts/a-love-letter-to-mumbai.md) as well.&#x20;

I was always panicky about things to pack and stuff like that but at the end of the day its you having enough money, a travel bag and essential things to survive. I will keep that in mind.&#x20;

Returned to working out. I feel good after working out. I missed it. Getting back into a routine and finding balance. Mumbai effect I guess. Work is gonna get heavy, so I guess I should be preparing mentally and physically. I hope things work out in the end.&#x20;

***

I guess I am missing out on a lot of things in these letters so I guess it will be better if I keep on updating these kinds of every week when I think of something. Will do this from September onwards.&#x20;

PS: Reading a lot of coffee was not a good decision.&#x20;

***

Started using notion to record my thoughts and things I find useful in life and in work.&#x20;

I always trusted my memory and believed in just living the moments without capturing it. But as I am getting older and becoming less hands-on at work, I guess it is important to note things so that you can share it and revisit it occasionally and to capture memories because it is worth sharing as well.&#x20;

### Watched

I don't know why but I guess I forgot to mention "bear" in July.&#x20;

It is a beautifully written, beautifully made show with a lot of heart. I have a lot of scenes that I love and want to revisit from the bear.&#x20;

Apart from the watched a lot, few movies I loved

* Jailer&#x20;
* Past Lives&#x20;
* Maveeran&#x20;
* Blue Beetle&#x20;
* No Hard Feelings&#x20;

### Reading

Trying to read "Love in the Time of Cholera"&#x20;

New work situation calls for a bit of upskilling so might read non fiction product management and leadership books.&#x20;

### Listening&#x20;

Listening more on youtube music. Mostly Indian movie soundtracks. (Jailer and Jawan on loop mode)&#x20;
