# 2023 September

September went by in a breeze and I can't seem to remember specific things from September today ðŸ˜‚

I guess I watched a lot of movies and tried to read as well.&#x20;

Again, September went by pretty fast and soon the year is gonna end as well and I am left wondering why was time so slow when I was young and why is it moving quick af now.&#x20;

### Listened&#x20;

Watched a new music video from the yellow diary and it was so good. It is called [Mann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTucXMU8ctw)
