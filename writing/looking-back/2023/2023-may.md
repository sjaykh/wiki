Having a cold is the worst feeling ever in the world.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:green;">**Note to self: I should travel more.**</mark>&#x20;

### Watched

Started watching "New Girl". The hunt for sitcoms continues.&#x20;

Rewatched "Good Will Hunting", such a good movie. Never loses its charm.&#x20;

Watched Air. Peak director affleck.&#x20;

Started watching Succession and I can't believe that I slept on this show till now.&#x20;

#### Guardians of the Galaxy and James Gunn&#x20;

I love James Gunn as a film maker. The importance he gives to stories is so good (as it should be) I am so hyped for the new DC universe and the amount of music it is gonna bring as well.&#x20;

GOTG was well done and I was so impressed with the soundtrack. Always on spotify now.&#x20;

### Reading

Trying to read more actively.&#x20;

Started "The art of racing in the rain"&#x20;

Also ordered "All Star Superman"&#x20;

### Listening&#x20;

#### Mixtapes

25 awesome songs = 1 mixtape&#x20;

Started with the first mixtape. The songs hugely inspired from GOTG3.&#x20;

### Finds&#x20;

Stumbled upon [letterstozoe](https://letterstozoe.com/) and its so beautiful, pretty sure that I'll be waiting for new letters and reading them as well.&#x20;

Reminded me of an [old google ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhPklt9nYas). &#x20;

Found [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/sjaykh), it basically gives a cool report on our listening activity. I've connected it with my spotify account. &#x20;
