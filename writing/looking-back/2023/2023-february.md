Sort of have this confusion or the awareness of an abyss that needs to be filled. Feels like missing out a lot on pop culture, movies, shows and stuff that I love.&#x20;

### Listened&#x20;

### Watched

The Last of Us is going great. Such a good show.&#x20;

Finished watching Farzi. Great expansion to the Family Man universe. What's with all the universe stuff now.&#x20;

Catching up with How I Met Your Mother. My single source for discovering awesome songs these days!!&#x20;

### Reading

Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow (or atleast trying to)&#x20;

### Interesting
