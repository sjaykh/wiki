24 this month. &#x20;

### Watched

And finally, finished watching HIMYM. I glady skipped the last two episodes. For me the show ended with Barney and Robin marrying and Ted meeting the mother. I don't why they had to ruin something like that by undoing a ton of character development and making Ted chase Robin again. No. Nope.&#x20;

#### Scenes ❤️

### Reading

Still trying. Not actively reading. Meh need to move up from this.&#x20;

* Completed reading "Stoner" and it was great.&#x20;
