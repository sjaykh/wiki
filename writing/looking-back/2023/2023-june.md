### Watched

Across the Spiderverse is seriously one of the best movies I have watched. Its been long since I truly enjoyed watching something in the big screen. Fully involved for two and a half hours and on top of that the 4DX was the best ever!!&#x20;

Continuing with Succession.&#x20;

Apart from that watched,&#x20;

* The Fablemans&#x20;
* Blackberry&#x20;
* Good luck to you, Leo Grande (such a delightful movie ❤️)

### Reading

'The Art of Racing in the Rain'&#x20;

### Listening&#x20;

Calling and Hummingbird from Across the Spiderverse are gems!&#x20;
