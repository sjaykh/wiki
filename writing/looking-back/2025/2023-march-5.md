### Listened&#x20;

Kahe Kahe - Yellow Diaries&#x20;

### Notes&#x20;

Read - Life of Chuck, waiting to watch the movie as well.&#x20;

Stephen King mania continues, I am starting a lot of books, I have to be patient and read one to the end before starting another.&#x20;

Got a cold but bounced back fairly easily, working out and having a good diet is paying off. Blood reports also came back good. Need to focus more on the diet.&#x20;
