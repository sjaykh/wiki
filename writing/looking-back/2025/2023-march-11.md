Socialising is good. Attending wedding of friends might also be good. I usually don’t prefer going to wedding but one of my close friends or she was my close friend before we parted in different direction.&#x20;

My thought is to go there and meet others. <br>

The wedding plan was right. It was amazing to see my old friends :)<br>

Getting out of the quick delivery world. Tender coconut. Handshake with the person :) little things that make the world a bit more enjoyable

December loneliness is creeping in and I don’t know what to do about it. It has been like this for a few years now. December towards the end just fucks me up. I don’t know when I will bounce back.&#x20;



December, I love the climate and the atmosphere okke. Pakshe it leaves me out so lonely. Aching in my chest. Hiraeth. Longing and everything. I miss my friends and I miss my potential life. I want to hangout chumma with them. December is the time for that pakshe ellarum is away.&#x20;
