This tweet by Gurpriya affected me so close to my heart.&#x20;

Gurpriya is one of these people I admire a lot and look up to - not professionally but being the chill kind of person in life. Again I just know her from social media and a brief intership where she managed me, but from the posts, learnings she has, I aspire.&#x20;

### Listened&#x20;

### Watched

Creature Commandos is so good! Excited for the future of DCU. In James Gunn we trust.&#x20;

Abbot Elementary&#x20;

Watching 30 Rock , what a fun show!&#x20;

[Babu Ramachandran's interview with Tovino ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mwg-T1lBxQ)is one of the best interviews I have watched recently.

* Tovino's take on living one's life and being fit is an insipiration for me.&#x20;
