# 2025 May

I got hold of Harry Potter with the original covers, all 7 books. Made my month a good month.&#x20;

Along with that I have been hoarding a lot of Stephen King books. Looks like Rohan Joshi made me a fan.&#x20;

Watched "Padakkalam" and loved it.&#x20;

I should read books more patiently and write more reading notes and add it to wiki.&#x20;

Having been hitting the gym consistently and honetly it is great. Food/diet is a bit off track though. Muscle mass is the focus for now, I can cut later.

Rains are back in Kochi.&#x20;

I have been rewatching movies. Earlier I used to feel like it was a waste of time but I am enjoying this now. Hangover is still hillarious. Modern Family is GOATED for rewatches.&#x20;

Read more, rewatch those comfort movies, find calm :)&#x20;
