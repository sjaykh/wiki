Still the "interest" part remains but it has evolved more into being somewhere where I am happy and excited to solve the problems that I care about.&#x20;

Money is a factor but just to support myself financially, above the money the complexity and quality of the problems is what matters:)&#x20;

Work for me is primarily to support myself financially. In all honesty I guess I "work work" for the money.&#x20;

At the same time I have this pressing need to satisfy my curiosity and keep myself sane. I need to be working in and at something I find "interesting"&#x20;

So while choosing a job, the aim was to find a balance - to learn and to earn.&#x20;

Currently the interest is in product management, majorly because it allows to dabble my feet in a bit of everything.&#x20;
