# üîç Product Management

I work as a product manager.&#x20;

I don't care much about the title and I am pretty sure that the title or the whole product domain will change in the future.&#x20;

My definition of product management is simply, problem solving.&#x20;

My role or what I like to do no matter the title or definition is to investigate and discover the top/important problems to be solved, and create impact by solving the problem. It doesn't matter if I am the one who solved the problem. Continuously evaluate the outcomes of the solutions to learn and improve.

I want to be as close to these interesting problems as possible.&#x20;
