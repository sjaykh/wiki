# ðŸŒ† Learnings

### Life&#x20;

* Learn to sit back, relax and observe. Not everything need a reaction
* Give yourself enough respect to walk away from someone who does need see your worth
* Learn how to stop telling people more than they need to know
* More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions.
* Have less regrets\*

### Writing&#x20;

* Be clear. Be consice.&#x20;
* Use adverbs sparingly, they often undermine your point. Instead of `really like`, say `love`. Say more with less.

### Conversations&#x20;

* Donâ€™t multitask - be present with mind.
* Enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. Donâ€™t just try to get your point across. Everybody is an expert in some thing.
* Use open ended questions. Who what when where why how.
* Go with the flow. Thoughts will come into your mind and go out of your mind. Let them go. Donâ€™t think for two minutes about a clever question to ask.
* If you donâ€™t know say that you donâ€™t know.
* Donâ€™t equate your experience with theirs. It is never the same. Itâ€™s not about you. Donâ€™t take that moment. Conversations are not A promotional opportunity.
* Try not to repeat yourself.
* Stay out of the weeds. People donâ€™t care about the years the names The dates all those details.
* Listen. Buddha: if your mouth is open youâ€™re not learning. Calvin Coolidge: no man ever listened his way out of a job. We donâ€™t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.
* Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
