# 🌆 Learnings

### Life&#x20;

* Learn to sit back, relax and observe. Not everything need a reaction
* More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions.
* Give yourself enough respect to walk away from people who does not see your worth
* Learn how to stop telling people more than they need to know
* A strong personality is built on **presence**—pausing to think and listening deeply to others.
* Have less regrets\*

### Writing&#x20;

* Be clear. Be consice.&#x20;
* Use adverbs sparingly, they often undermine your point. Instead of `really like`, say `love`. Say more with less.

### Conversations&#x20;

* Don’t multitask - be present with mind.
* **Enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn**. Don’t just try to get your point across. **Everybody is an expert in some thing.**
* A strong personality is built on **presence**—pausing to think and listening deeply to others.
* Use open ended questions. Who what when where why how.
* Go with the flow. Thoughts will come into your mind and go out of your mind. Let them go. Don’t think for two minutes about a clever question to ask.
* **If you don’t know say that you don’t know.**
* **Don’t equate your experience with theirs. It is never the same. It’s not about you. Don’t take that moment. Conversations are not A promotional opportunity.**
* Try not to repeat yourself.
* **Stay out of the weeds**. People don’t care about the years the names The dates all those details.
* Listen. Buddha: if your mouth is open you’re not learning. Calvin Coolidge: no man ever listened his way out of a job. We don’t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.
* Be brief. A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
* **Practice Tactical Pauses**:
  * When someone asks a question or makes a point:
    * Pause for **3–5 seconds** before responding.
    * During this pause, silently think: _“What’s the core problem? What’s the most impactful response?”_
  * Use transition phrases like:
    * _“Let me think about that for a moment…”_
    * _“That’s a great point—here’s my perspective.”_
* After every conversation, **summarise what you heard** before speaking.
* Spend 5 minutes post-conversation analyzing:
  * _What went well?_
  * _What could I have communicated more effectively?_
* **During Work**:
  * Pause before responding in meetings.
  * Ask at least **one probing question** in every conversation.
  * Summarize key takeaways at the end of each meeting.
