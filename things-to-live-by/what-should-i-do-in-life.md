# 🧭 What should I do in life?

> When people ask me for a framework to decide what to do in life, I ask them to imagine themselves in their 40s, and then ask what would their ideal life look like then.
>
> If they can’t think of anything, I ask them to think of a person who is in their 40s and whose life they admire the most.
>
> Then I ask them what are the aspects of this person’s life they admire and want to have.

For me, instead of aspiring to live the life of a specific person, I think of the traits I want to have by the time I am 50.
