# Priorities

I am slow in making major decisions, sometimes I jump into decisions without thinking about the repercussions. Often time I find myself sacrificing my needs for the sake of that decision.&#x20;

The purpose of this page is to list down my priorities. If the decision affects these priorities then I guess it won't work out for me in the long term.&#x20;

There might be some instances where I might have to sacrifice these priorities but that should only be for a short term.&#x20;

* Sleep&#x20;
  * 7-8 hours a day&#x20;
  * Exceptions are okay, but ideally if I make a decision that majorly affects my sleep cycle - it might not be the right decision.&#x20;
  * Everything else gets deprioritized before this.
* Good Air&#x20;
  * Life is better when the air you breathe in is clean. It is not always in my control, but if I make a decision to move or if I get an opportunity, this should be an important factor.&#x20;
* Good Water&#x20;
  * Again, not completely in control but water, clean source is important.&#x20;
  * 2-3 litres everyday&#x20;
* Good/Clean/Safe Food&#x20;
  * Identify safe places to eat.&#x20;
  * Don't sacrifice there, even if the cost is a bit high - eat clean.&#x20;
  * Try to cook as much as you can.&#x20;
  * High-protein, minimally processed, portion-controlled.
  * No compromise when the body is your primary engine.
* Low Drama&#x20;
  * No chaos, no toxicity, no emotional drain.
  * Anyone or anything that repeatedly disrupts peace gets distance
  * Don't bottle up feelings, speak openly.&#x20;
* New Experiences&#x20;
* Relationships & Community
  * Family is important&#x20;
  * Reach out to friends and family as much as I can
  * Wish on everyone birthdays&#x20;
  * Initiate conversations - smile, hello, how are you.&#x20;
  * Try to gift people on their birthdays&#x20;
* **The Sunlight Test**
  * If you can’t defend an action openly, you shouldn’t take it.
  * Ethics over shortcuts
  * Take the hard road.&#x20;

## **The Priorities Doctrine**

**1. Protect the foundations.**\
Sleep, air, water, and clean food take precedence over everything else.\
If the body is unstable, decisions are unreliable.

**2. Build a life with no avoidable drama.**\
Anything that consistently disturbs peace is removed.\
Stability is a strategic advantage, not a luxury.

**3. Act with curiosity.**\
Learn something every day.\
Choose new experiences that expand capability, not chaos.

**4. Practice disciplined repetition.**\
Small, consistent actions beat rare intensity.\
Motivation is optional; showing up is not.

**5. Live by the Lighthouse.**\
Every action must strengthen at least one pillar:\
Physical health, mental health, profession, personal growth, relationships, or finances.\
If it weakens a pillar, reconsider.

**6. Use the Sunlight Test.**\
No decisions you would hide.\
No shortcuts you cannot justify openly.\
Integrity compounds.

**7. Stay in the present moment.**\
No loops of past guilt or future simulation.\
Action belongs to the now.

**8. Prioritize long-term compounding work.**\
Health.\
High-impact product leadership.\
Creative output.\
Deep relationships.\
Continuous learning.\
These shape the trajectory of your entire life.

**9. When in doubt, simplify.**\
Remove, reduce, and streamline until the priority becomes obvious.\
The mind thinks clearly when the environment is clean.

**10. Align decisions with the person you are becoming, not the person you were.**\
Every choice is a vote for your future identity.\
Make each vote count.
