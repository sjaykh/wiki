# Priorities

I am slow in making major decisions, sometimes I jump into decisions without thinking about the repercussions. Often time I find myself sacrificing my needs for the sake of that decision.&#x20;

The purpose of this page is to list down my priorities. If the decision affects these priorities then I guess it won't work out for me in the long term.&#x20;

There might be some instances where I might have to sacrifice these priorities but that should only be for a short term.&#x20;

* Sleep&#x20;
* Good Air&#x20;
* Good Water&#x20;
* Good/Clean/Safe Food&#x20;
* Low Drama&#x20;
* New Experiences&#x20;
